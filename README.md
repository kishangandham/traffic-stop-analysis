# traffic-stop-analysis

Our research question is as follows: Do age, race, and gender affect the frequency, outcomes, and causes of traffic stops in Durham? 
More granularly, we hypothesize that black, male, and younger drivers are more likely to be searched, frisked, and arrested than other groups of Durham drivers.
